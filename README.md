# Homes_For_Good_Script

This is a Visual Basic script that converts Excel profiles to PDF with appropriate fields. The script was created as part of a project for Homes for Good, where it was used to automate the process of generating PDF reports from Excel data.

How it Works
The script loops through each row of an Excel worksheet, copying the values to another worksheet that serves as a template for generating the PDF report. Once all the data has been copied, the script saves the report as a PDF file with a filename based on the profile's name and date range.

Usage
To use this script, open the Excel file containing the profiles you want to convert to PDF, and then run the script. The PDF reports will be saved in the folder specified in the script.

Dependencies
This script requires Microsoft Excel to run. It was developed and tested using Microsoft Excel 2016, but should work with other versions of Excel as well.
